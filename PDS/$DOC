 File 489 pertains to:

 SMS INVISION "dayend" (ie: batch process) improvements/changes.

 Terms:
   SHARED MEDICAL SYSTEMS (SMS) - was acquired by Siemens
   Software Update Tape (SUT) - of course transitioned to FTP delivery
   "dayend" is the overnight batch process
   INVISION is their patient registration and patient accounting
     software that runs on an S/390 platform

 These processes were developed to help document and streamline
 the installation of their SUT tapes.

 Probably by now - 2019 - anyone who had interest in using these
 tools for Invision would have downloaded them already.  However,
 the input parms are still useful as examples for other types
 of solutions, especially using CHNGFILE and PULLFILE on CBT file 488.

  Overview
  --------

  SHARED MEDICAL SYSTEMS is (well - was) one of the largest healthcare
  software providers in the country.  For the INVISION system (patient
  accounting and registration systems), updates are sent on SUT
  tapes.  They arrive both monthly and quarterly.  Installation
  is a fairly manual process: download software, apply site
  modifications, document steps, etc.

  Data centers that receive SUT tapes from SMS are called
  ICO sites (In-house computing option).  The site runs
  SMS software on their own machine.  SMS also runs their software
  on their machines in Malvern, PA.  This option is called
  RCO (remote computing option).

  These routines are geared towards ICO shops that run INVISION.

  These routines attempt to automate some of the SUT install process.
  Documentation is spread throughout the SUT install libraries.
  SUT install steps are documented.
  Backup JCL is automatically generated.
  Site modifications are automatically placed in the install jcl.

  Some of the utilities in CBT FILE489 require programs
  or other members located in CBT FILE488.

  NEWWAIT is used throughout these utilities and is located
  on CBT file 270.


  SUT INSTALL  When SISTDAPL is run, other jobs/jcl are placed in
               the APPLYJCL file.  These jobs perform the
               following:

               1.  spread the primary tape number throughout the
                   SUT install jobs for documentation purposes.
               2.  compare what is being delivered with a list
                   of items requiring early notification.
                   generate a report listing flagged elements and
                   who is associated with them
               3.  automatically generate backup jcl
               4.  make repetitive jcl changes to the staging
                   libraries automatically (ie: change the space
                   definition for a file, or change UNIT= parameter,
                   or add DATACLAS= parameters to a file.

  PX ADHOCS    INVISION generates most of its reports using ADHOCS.
               These can sometimes run for quite awhile.  If there are
               problems then they are usually restarted from the
               beginning.

               This process splits the PX ADHOCS into multiple files.
               They are then run sequentially.  This reduces the
               possibility that an error will require a restart from
               the beginning, and also reduces the likelyhood of
               errors, since less adhocs run in each step.

               IF you name your PX adhocs as *$PXZxxx then another
               copy of PAP19A6$, called PXADHOCZ, will process them.
               Use this for PX adhocs that do not have post-dayend
               dependencies.
