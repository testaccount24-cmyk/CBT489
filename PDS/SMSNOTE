  SUT APPLY PREPARATION

  ----------------------------------------------------------
  quarterly numbered suts:  ie: 98.2
      these require downtime.  follow install procedures as delivered
      in the 'software apply procedure manual'.
      perform functions below, paying close attention to the
      sixsc$$$ output, altering the staging double-high-level
      libraries as needed to reflect previous svmmc changes.

      Double check for CICS modules that belong in the LPA -
      see SYS1.CICS410.SDFHLPA.

  monthly alpha suts:  ie: 98.E
      these generally do not require downtime.  review the sistdapl
      output for software apply procedures (which always include
      running pap99a6$/pat99a6$ after cpy2prod/cpy2test).

      skip steps: SMSLOAD, (interfaces), (drop cics's).

      sometimes we rename alpha sut staging libraries so that
      numbered sut staging libraries can be brought down from tape.
      these are changed from PLSMS.PLSMS to PLSMS.######:
      ###### is the primary tape number, PLSMS.PLSMS might be
      PDSMS.PDSMS, TLSMS.TLSMS, TDSMS.TDSMS.
      change cpy2prod/cpy2test as needed to load from these libraries
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  1.  check tape number, be sure this is not a duplicate of existing
        maint library names.  if so, delete old maint library.
        ex: PLSMS.TMSI.SITE.APPLYJCL.VSX01048 where X01048 is the
        tape name.

  2.  issue sistdapl command to download tapes to maint library
        ex: S SISTDAPL,VOLSER=X0XXXX
        ex: S SISTDAPL,VOLSER=X0XXXX,OVOL=X0XXXX
        ex: S SISTDAPL,VOLSER=X0XXXX,OVOL='X0XXXX,X0XXXX'

        VSILPROD and VSILTEST will abend because CHPP1330 is not
        in the regular library due to bad TTR's.  Add
        PLSMS.SMBSM00L.P0000.LOAD.ALIAS to their joblib.
        if no VSILTEST/VSILPROD report was created then there
        are no VSAM updates on the sut.

  3.  copy member 'SMSDOC' above all jobs to run for sut apply
        CPY2TEST DBHLTEST SIYSC$$$ VSILTEST
        CPY2PROD DBHLPROD SIXSC$$$ VSILPROD

  4.  update SMSCHNG variable with the
        6 digit sut tape name (ex: X08195) and submit

  5.  mass replace all '###### ............ ' with sut name,
        such as:       '###### .............'
      mass replace all 'D##T0A6' with the member name found
        in the PLSMS.TMSI.SITE.TAPEDOC.VS###### library,
        such as:       'D73T0A6' or 'D73HHRR'

  6.  submit SMSCOMP.  if 2 or more members exist, run for each.
        (ie:  D##T0A6: T = invision.  D##E0A6: E = ead)
        This process creates 3 files:
          PDSMS.SUT0.######.D##HHRR.ELEMENT.LIST
          PDSMS.SUT0.######.D##HHRR.PROBLEM.DESC
          PDSMS.SUT0.######.D##HHRR.APPLY.COMMENT
        This process also creates 2 reports which are sent to
          rms-online below

  7.  see i below
      Quarterly SUT's: because the SISTDAPL report generated
        by initiating the SISTDAPL proc includes both D##T0A6
        and D##E0A6 data, delete the SISTDAPL report and
        reprint only the D##T0A6 member using SMSPRNT.
      Purge unwanted reports
      run SMSJES1
      run SMSXROX if a quarterly numbered SUT
      run SMSU418 if a monthly alpha SUT

  8.  update the comment line in cpy2prod (step SIL0DLVR)
      to further clarify what is on the tape.  run SMSMAIL.
      cut and paste entries from SMSMAILO and send.

  9.  If the SUT updates a CICS file, such as the ICDAFILE,
        you may be able to close and open it while cics stays up:
        in IANNONE.ISPF.LIBRARY.SMS:  RMSRSVP     RMSRELP
                                      RMSRSVT     RMSRELT
        - add to cpy2test and cpy2prod
        - if necessary, stop interfaces when using

  10. prepare backups:
       a.  run SMSBFIL
       b.  copy SMSBFILO into smsbkup, modify the dataset list,
           and update the backup tape name
             pre-aply:   backup all libraries affected by apply process
                           immediately before sut install
             dbhl-del:   delete double-high-level files after sut apply
       c.  use SMSCOPY to make dasd copies of target datasets, if
           desired.  copy SMSBFILO into the include area of smscopy,
           and SMSBFILC into the renameu area.

  11. production quarterly suts only:
        alter SMSLOAD if needed.
        also review SMSCICS if CICS maintenance is being delivered.

  12. Perform standard sut apply procedures

      test-  dbhltest,
             run SMSJOBS (change &pl, &pt, nbrb symbolics)
             see ii below,
             global replace: unit=smsda to sysda, dev1=smsda etc
             siysc$$$: in output queue as iannoney - review carefully
             smsjes1,
             alter dbhl libs (see iii below),
             update sut apply documentation to include smsbkup, etc,
             (interfaces), (drop cics's),
             (empty load libs if instructed, but only if sut levels
              are the same - otherwise this will backlevel test)
             smsbkup w/pre-aply, cpy2test, (post apply jobs),
             send mail,
             retrieve migrated libs, smsbkup w/dbhl-del,
             delete IANNONEY jcl from held queue,
             run smsjes2, then smsxrox or smsU418,
             update IANNONE.ISPF.LIBRARY(SMSSUT)

      prod-  dbhlprod,
             run SMSJOBS (change &pl, &pt, nbrb symbolics)
             see ii below,
             global replace: unit=smsda to sysda, dev1=smsda etc
             sixsc$$$: in output queue as iannonex - review carefully
             smsjes1,
             alter dbhl libs (see iii below),
             update sut apply documentation to include smsbkup, etc,
             (interfaces), (drop cics's),
             smsbkup w/pre-aply, smscopy, smsload, cpy2prod,
             (post apply jobs),
             send mail,
             retrieve migrated libs, smsbkup w/dbhl-del,
             delete IANNONEX jcl from held queue,
             run smsjes2, then smsxrox or smsU418,
             update IANNONE.ISPF.LIBRARY(SMSSUT)

  ----------------------------------------------------------

  i.  after each run:
           (jobs SMSJES1&2 will perform most of the following)
       a.  delete jcl:
             VSILTEST  DBHLTEST  SIYSC$$$  IANNONES
             VSILPROD  SISTDAPL  SIXSC$$$
       b.  place reports in a class of 'r'
             SIXSC$$$  VSILPROD  SISTDAPL  MIS0485B
             SIYSC$$$  VSILTEST  HPPI####
             note: job pa?41a6? may create 2 reports: delete the one
                   that does not have 'hppi####' in the writer field
       c.  place jcl in class of 's'
             DBHLPROD  CPY2PROD
             IANNONES  CPY2TEST
       d.  run SMSXROX or SMSU418

  ii.  altering dbhl libraries based on output from siysc$$$
       or sixsc$$$:

           //*....JCI....yymmdd filename  change

       -   the above comment format is used to indicate a change
           in a proc or job.  Use this format when adapting jcl
           to reflect svmmc modifications.
           Cut and paste this into the dbhl libraries.
           When in doubt - go with what sms delivered.
           In siysc$$$ or sixsc$$$, find 'OVERALL' to skip to
           the next library comparison.
       -   delete vol=ref= statements for temp files (&&)
       -   check for high region requests, change to 20m or 7800k
